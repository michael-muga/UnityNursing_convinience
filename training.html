                        situations present themselves, we have our Rapid Care Response system for quick service.
                    </p>

                        which not only provides ongoing training through courses and webinars, but offers our Caregivers the opportunity to earn certifications of Specialist, Expert, and Master, each of which differentiates the skill sets of each of our
                        staff.

                    </h5>
                    <p>This video series was designed with flexibility in mind. It can be used by caregivers, health professionals and educators. You can view one video segment (behavior) at a time or all together in one sitting. Additionally, educators
                        can use the videos for one-on-one or group instruction.</p>

                    <p>Lauren's mother runs into the living room, scared. Lauren gets up and tells her mother she'll "take care of it." She goes into the bedroom and immediately notices the trigger, a coat rack and hat projecting a shadow on the wall. She
                        removes the trigger from the room and reassures her. She kisses her mother goodnight.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Common response: </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Lauren's mother awakens at night and is scared by a shadow on the wall. She runs to the living room and asks Lauren for help. Frustrated, Lauren takes her mother to her room, turns on the light, shows her there's nobody there, and
                        tells her to go back to bed.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Expert explanation:</h5>
                    <p>HALLUCINATIONS are a result of a problem in the part of the brain that helps interpret sights and sounds. Hallucinations involve seeing or hearing things that aren't there. They can be frightening for the person with dementia. A good
                        approach to reduce the occurrence of HALLUCINATIONS is to remove the objects that trigger them.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Mother is lying in bed during the day. Daughter asks her mother to get up but mother refuses. Daughter gives up and leaves the room discouraged.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Expert explanation:</h5>
                    <p>Depression and apathy occur in many persons with dementia. Apathy is different from depression. With apathy, a person may experience a lack of motivation, effort or energy to do everyday tasks, no longer have interest in talking with
                        others or participating in activities, or show a lack of reaction to people or things that occur. People with depression may be sad or tearful, irritable, restless and have feelings of low self-worth. People with depression may
                        also have sleep problems, loss of energy and appetite changes. See medical attention if the behavior is significant or if it is a sudden change from their usual self.</p>
                    <h5>Recommended response:</h5>
                    <p> Mother is lying in bed during the day. Mother initially refuses to get up from bed. Daughter uses an incentive for mother to get out of bed by saying her friend is coming to visit. Mother is excited that she is having a visitor and
                        gets out of bed. Mother goes to the living room and is enjoys working on a jigsaw puzzle with her friend.

                    <h5>Expert explanation:</h5>
                    <p>REFUSAL TO TAKE MEDICATIONS is a common manifestation of dementia. Since taking medications is often a daily occurrence, refusal can cause caregiver frustration. The recommended approach is to stay calm. In addition, trying to explain
                        the consequences of not taking a medication may not be understood by persons with more advanced dementias.

                    <h5>Recommended response:</h5>
                    <p> Stacey approaches her grandmother in a gentle way and sits next to her on the couch. Her grandmother challenges her and she responds by reading a note from the doctor that her grandmother remembers and respects. Stacey reads it slowly
                        and clearly so her grandmother can understand. She encourages her grandmother to take her medication for the doctor.
