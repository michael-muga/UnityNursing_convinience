                        <h5>Expert explanation:</h5>
                        <p>Depression and apathy occur in many persons with dementia. Apathy is different from depression. With apathy, a person may experience a lack of motivation, effort or energy to do everyday tasks, no longer have interest in talking
                            with others or participating in activities, or show a lack of reaction to people or things that occur. People with depression may be sad or tearful, irritable, restless and have feelings of low self-worth. People with depression
                            may also have sleep problems, loss of energy and appetite changes. See medical attention if the behavior is significant or if it is a sudden change from their usual self.</p>
                        <h5>Recommended response:</h5>

                            and gets out of bed. Mother goes to the living room and is enjoys working on a jigsaw puzzle with her friend.
